# Sound-Detector
This circuit called ‘Sound Detector’ is what detects vibrations  of the sound waves and amplifies it to be heard distinctly by human ears. 
The Circuit is designed on Proteus using Operational Amplifiers, Darlington pair of transistors and microphone
Sometimes due to lack of concentration and our ignorance, we are unable to hear anything around us. 
And, that could lead to unfortunate misfortunes which could have been avoided 
with appropriate precautions. This circuit called ‘Sound Detector’ is what detects vibrations 
of the sound waves and amplifies it to be heard distinctly by human ears
